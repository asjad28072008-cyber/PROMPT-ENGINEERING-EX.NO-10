## Date:21-12-2025
## Reg. No.25013957

## Aim:
To demonstrate how various prompting techniques (query decomposition, decision-making, semantic filtering, etc.) can be employed to create content such as reports, articles, case studies, or creative works like comic books, using ChatGPT or similar models. The objective is to highlight how different prompt structures affect the content's quality, coherence, and structure.

## Procedure:
1.	Introduction to Prompt Patterns: Begin by understanding the following prompt patterns:
○	Query Decomposition: Breaking down complex queries into smaller, actionable parts.
○	Decision Making: Asking the model to choose between options or directions.
○	Answer Engineering: Refining outputs by giving detailed instructions on how to structure or format the answer.
○	Fact Check List: Ensuring the content is factually accurate, especially for reports or case studies.
○	Tail Generation: Extending the content logically to create depth in storytelling or analysis.
○	Menu Actions: Presenting multiple action choices and guiding the AI to select one.
○	Semantic Filter: Applying filters to control the tone, style, and accuracy of the content.
2.	Choosing the Content Type: Decide on the type of content you want to create. This could be:
○	Reports (e.g., industry analysis, sustainability reports, etc.)
○	Case Studies (e.g., business solutions, technological innovations)
○	Articles (e.g., opinion pieces, educational articles)
○	Creative Content (e.g., comic book story, short stories, video scripts)
3.	For example, you could choose a business report on market trends, a case study on a successful startup, or even a story-based prompt like creating a fictional world for a comic.
4.	Creating the Prompts:
○	Start with simple prompts to generate initial content.
○	Gradually refine the prompts, moving toward more complex techniques like decision-making (asking the model to pick one of several options), tail generation (extending the narrative), and semantic filtering (adjusting style or tone).
5.	Generating and Refining Outputs: Use the model to generate initial drafts, and then refine the outputs using iterative adjustments:
○	For a report, prompt the model with basic data, then ask for a deeper analysis and insights.
○	For creative content, refine the initial story idea with specific details on characters, settings, or actions.
6.	Review and Evaluation: After generating content, evaluate the outputs for:
○	Coherence: Is the generated content logical and structured?
○	Creativity/Originality: Is the content engaging and fresh?
○	Accuracy: Is the content factually accurate (for reports and case studies)?
○	Tone and Style: Does the content match the intended tone (formal, creative, educational)?

# Basic prompt 2:create a  science fiction story of a man going to the sun and admires the beauty of it in 500 words

# output:
The Man Who Walked Toward the Sun

For centuries, humanity feared the Sun—not for its beauty, but for its unbearable power. Yet Dr. Arin Kael stood aboard the solar vessel Helios One, watching the blazing sphere grow larger through the reinforced viewport. He was not afraid. He was in awe.

The ship was built with revolutionary solar-shielding technology, a fusion of artificial intelligence, adaptive nanomaterials, and magnetic deflection fields. Guided by an AI companion named LUX, Helios One moved closer to the Sun than any human vessel ever had. Arin had dedicated his life to this moment—not to conquer the Sun, but to understand it.

As the ship crossed the solar corona, waves of golden plasma danced like living fire. Solar flares arched across the surface, massive and elegant, like cosmic brushstrokes painted by the universe itself. Arin felt small, yet deeply connected. This star was the source of all life on Earth, and now he was close enough to witness its true grandeur.

Against all expectations, Arin stepped into the observation chamber, where a transparent energy field separated him from destruction. The AI stabilized the field, allowing him to stand “beneath” the Sun’s light. The heat was unimaginable, yet perfectly controlled. For the first time in history, a human stood near the heart of a star.

The Sun was not silent. It hummed—a deep, rhythmic resonance that vibrated through the chamber and into Arin’s chest. LUX translated the solar oscillations into sound, creating a symphony born from nuclear fusion itself. Arin closed his eyes, overwhelmed by emotion. This was not just science; it was art.

He realized then that the Sun was not merely a ball of fire, but a living engine of creation—forging energy, time, and possibility. The fear humanity once held had blinded them to its beauty. Here, amid radiation and light, Arin felt peace.

Before returning, Arin released thousands of nano-probes, each carrying data that would transform energy production on Earth forever—clean, limitless, and inspired directly by the Sun’s own processes. His journey was not for glory, but for hope.

As Helios One began its retreat, Arin took one last look. The Sun burned on, eternal and magnificent, indifferent yet generous. He smiled.

Humanity had finally learned not just to survive under the Sun—but to admire it.

# Refined prompt:create a detailed science fiction story of a astronaunt who explores the universe in a house which is about the size of a football stadium and the struggles he goes to reach his destination crossing stars and blackholes with the sighting of new life he doesn't believe himself that he made this far in life

# output:
The House That Crossed the Universe

The house was the size of a football stadium, floating silently through the universe like a drifting continent of steel and glass. It was not just a home—it was a spacecraft, a sanctuary, and the last dream of humanity. Inside lived Aren Kael, the lone astronaut who had chosen isolation over extinction. As Earth faded into a pale memory, Aren often stood beneath the transparent dome of the house, staring at the stars, unable to believe he had come this far in life—from a child gazing at the night sky to a man crossing it.

The journey was never meant to be easy. The house moved using a gravity-bending core that pulled spacetime itself, allowing Aren to cross distances that once took millennia. But with every star he passed, new dangers emerged. Radiation storms rattled the walls like thunder. Rogue asteroids scraped across the outer shields, leaving scars like battle wounds. Still, Aren pressed forward, repairing systems with trembling hands, driven by a hope he could barely explain.

The first black hole nearly ended everything. Its dark presence bent light, time, and Aren’s mind. Inside the house, clocks ran unevenly, rooms stretched and shrank, and nightmares felt more real than waking life. Aren fought panic, anchoring himself by remembering Earth—rain, laughter, warmth. With careful calculations and immense courage, he used the black hole’s gravity to slingshot forward, escaping just before the house was torn apart.

Beyond that darkness, the universe changed. Stars glowed in unfamiliar colors, and planets pulsed with life. On a distant world, Aren encountered something impossible—living beings made of light and sound, communicating not with words but emotions. They showed him visions of civilizations that rose and fell, of humans being remembered long after they were gone. For the first time, Aren cried—not from fear, but from wonder.

As the journey continued, loneliness weighed heavier than gravity. The vast halls of the house echoed with silence. Aren questioned his purpose, doubted his strength, and wondered if he was only chasing an illusion. Yet every sunrise over a new star reminded him why he began—to prove that humanity could go beyond its limits.

At the edge of the observable universe, Aren stood beneath the dome once more. Galaxies spiraled like living art. He whispered to himself, disbelief in his voice, “I made it.” Not just across space, but across fear, doubt, and destiny.

The house continued onward, carrying a man who had crossed stars and black holes—and found himself among them.
